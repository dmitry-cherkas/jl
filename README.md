# jl â€” JSON Logs

`jl` is a development tool for working with structured JSON logging.

### Examples

    $ myprogram
    {"message": "Hello, world!!", "severity": "info"}
    {"message": "skipping file", "severity": "warn", "file": "empty.txt"}

    $ myprogram | jl
       INFO: Hello, world!!
    WARNING: skipping file [file=empty.txt]

### Installation

    $ go get -u github.com/koenbollen/jl
    $ echo '{"msg": "It works!"}' | jl
    It works!

### Usage

```
Usage:
  jl [options] [FILE...]

Options:
  -h, --help    Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.

Output Options:
  --color           Force colorized output
  --no-color        Don't colorize output
  --skip-prefix     Skip printing truncated bytes before the JSON
  --skip-suffix     Skip printing truncated bytes after the JSON

Formatting Options:
  --skip-fields     Don't output misc json keys as fields
  --include-fields  <fields>, -f <fields> Always include these json keys as fields (comma seperated list)

You can add any option to the JL_OPTS environment variable, ex:
  export JL_OPTS="--no-color"
```

### Compatibility

`jl` tries to dynamically parse the lines to support as many well
known formats as possible.

Is `jl` not compatible with your structured logging? Please let me
know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/koenbollen/jl/issues/new).
